            Yo! Jā ikou zo! Jankenpon!
            They tell me, "Keep it simple", I tell them, "Take it slow"
            I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
            I tell them, "Take it easy", they laugh and tell me "no"
            It's cool but I don't see them laughin' at my money though

            They spittin' facts at me, I'm spittin' tracks, catch me?
            I'm spinnin' gold out my records, know you can't combat me
            They tell me, "Jesus walks", I tell them, "Money talks"
            Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an icebox

            They tell me I've been sleepin', I say, "I'm wide awake"
            Tracks hot and ready so they call me Mister Easy-Bake
            They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
            Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank

            Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
            The people always different but it always feels the same
            That's the real me, pop the champagne
            The haters wanna hurt me and I'm laughin' at the pain

            Stayin' still, eyes closed
            Let the world just pass me by
            Pain pills, nice clothes
            If I fall, I think I'll fly
            Touch me, Midas
            Make me part of your design
            None to guide us
            I feel fear for the very last time

            No Friends
            Casey Likes
            They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
            I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
            They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red"
            They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled

            They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
            Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
            They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade
            Six-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd

            No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
            Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
            They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
            The people blend together but I would be lost without their love

            Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
            When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
            Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
            It hurts me just to think and I don't do pain

            Stayin' still, eyes closed
            Let the world just pass me by
            Pain pills, nice clothes
            If I fall, I think I'll fly
            Touch me, Midas
            Make me part of your design
            None to guide us
            I feel fear for the very last time
            Lay still, restless
            Losing sleep while I lose my mind
            All thrill, no stress
            All my muses left behind (left behind)
            World is below
            So high up, I'm near-divine (I'm so high up)
            Lean in, let go
            I feel fear for the very last time
